    "# Wavelength offset correction\n",
    "\n",
    "The origin of small wavelength offsets in RSS data typically arises from several factors inherent in the observational and instrumental setup. These factors include slight misalignments or imperfections in the calibration process, such as errors in the wavelength calibration using reference lamps, and the finite precision of the spectrograph's grating or prism. Additionally, atmospheric effects, instrumental flexures, and variations in detector sensitivity can introduce minor shifts in the recorded wavelengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring a wavelength offset between fibers can be done using several features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Telluric Emission Lines**\n",
    "\n",
    "The location of sky emission lines is constant across the entire field of view (FoV) and can be used as a reference system to anchor the relative offset between fibers. If the lines are identified, they can also provide an absolute offset. This method is very accurate but requires the presence of bright sky emission lines in all fibers, which becomes complicated in the presence of bright sources. Additionally, bright sky emission lines are typically detected beyond 5577 $\\AA$ (corresponding to the auroral line produced by oxygen), making this method unsuitable for calibrating spectra in the blue region of the optical spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Telluric absorption lines**\n",
    "\n",
    "Absorption lines produced by the atmosphere can also be used to anchor the relative offset between fibers, although their treatment is more complicated compared to individual (deblended) sky emission lines. However, these features are more easily detected in the presence of bright sources, complementing the previous method. Unfortunately, telluric absorption becomes prominent only at red wavelengths, offering little utility for the calibration of blue spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cross-correlation with some reference spectra**\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative method involves comparing fiber spectra with a reference spectrum. The most common approach is to use twilight exposures taken at sunset, which include the Sun's spectrum reflected by the atmosphere. This is then cross-correlated with a high-resolution solar spectrum, allowing for highly accurate estimation of absolute wavelength offsets. The downside of this approach is its limitation to a few exposures taken at very specific times. If variations are introduced during the rest of the night (e.g., changes in temperature, pointing-dependent instrumental flexures), this method may be unable to correct them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use a set of twilight flat frames to compute a wavelength offset correction by cross-correlating them with a solar reference spectrum. In subsequent tutorials, users will also have the opportunity to refine the wavelength solution of RSS data using sky emission lines."

    "\n",
    "- After the reference solar spectra is interpolated to the RSS resolution, the method `get_solar_features` is called internally and it identifies regions dominated by absorption lines. An array of weights representing the prominence of absorption features is created. Usually, it is a good idea to clip a given fraction of pixels by setting their weights to zero, solely focusing on those sourrunding absorption lines. The parameter `keep_features_frac` can be used to vary such fraction (default is 5%). If users want to weight all pixels equally, they can provide a wavelength range (`wave_range`) and all\n",
    "pixels within will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The input fibre spectra is not flux calibrated, and requires a previous renormalization to account for the spectrograph response function. This is achieved via a median filter, whose width is controlled with the parameter `response_window_size_aa`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross-correlation is done by creating a grid of models with different offsets and LSF profiles. Users can provide both and array of shifts in pixels via `pix_shift_array`, as well as the values of $\\sigma$ for the gaussian LSF using `pix_std_array`. Depending on the resolution of the instrument/grating, and the specific scientific goals, more or less points would be needed. For a reasonable previus wavelength calibration, offsets are tipically ranging between 2 to 3 pixels, while the instrumental LSF might extend a few pixels.\n",
    "\n",
